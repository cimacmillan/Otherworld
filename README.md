# Otherworld

Otherworld is a web-based video game developed by [Callum Macmillan](https://github.com/cimacmillan) from Sep 2019 to December 2021. 

It uses a custom game engine, leveraging Typescript and WebGL. The in-game user interface and website are built using React and [Refunc](https://github.com/cimacmillan/Refunc).

It is hosted on AWS Amplify at [otherworld.io](https://other-world.io/)

See [deep dives](http://localhost/?page=deepdive) on the site for more information on the game systems. 

## Quick start guide

The game is hosted and available online. However, you can test your own changes by building the service locally. To start the otherworld development server, run this command:

```
sh build_dev.sh
```

You can then visit `http://localhost` to play the game. Any changes made will be automatically built. Refreshing the browser will sync new changes.
