# Otherworld - P0 Task board

Steps to complete before Phase 0 complete

### Backlog (Other)

- [ ] Service for fetching map or player entities. Service locator should be able to serve this so that the UI and other services can respond. Might also have to do this with events.  
- [ ] Basic player movement, speed, headbobbing etc. Player should respond to user input in a nice way.  
- [ ] Player can attack entities using some sort of interaction service that entities register themselves to. Interaction service determines what entity can be attacked by the player and either prioritises one or fetches all for sweep attacks.  
- [ ] Enemy spawner entity that requires a generic tick timer (refactor animation). Enemy spawner responds to enemy death events and respawns them.  
- [ ] Enemies can attack player by going towards them by finding player through the important entities service and using the interaction service to determine whether it can hit the player.  
- [ ] UI renders player health.  
- [ ] Downsample UI for retro effect.  
- [ ] Proper loading screen and resource loading from JSON  
- [ ] Proper deployment to micro AWS  
- [ ] Better in-game background song  
- [ ] Enemy attack animation  
- [ ] Player hurt animation  
- [ ] Dev mode / God mode controls for viewing maps  

### In Progress

- [ ] UI renders sword and hitting animation.  

### Done âœ“

- [x] Basic physics service to stop enemies colliding  
- [x] Enemy walking animation  
- [x] Single place that the game content is initialised from, including camera entities etc.  
- [x] Commands should be able to access player directly via some Entity get service and/or fire events to the world/entity.  
- [x] User input command system. Takes a context and provides an execute function.
