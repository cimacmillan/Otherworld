# Otherworld - P0 Task board

Steps to complete before Phase 0 complete

### Backlog (Other)

- [ ] User input command system. Takes a context and provides an execute function.  
- [ ] Commands should be able to access player directly via some Entity get service and/or fire events to the world/entity.  
- [ ] Service for fetching map or player entities. Service locator should be able to serve this so that the UI and other services can respond. Might also have to do this with events.  
- [ ] Basic player movement, speed, headbobbing etc. Player should respond to user input in a nice way.  
- [ ] Player can attack entities using some sort of interaction service that entities register themselves to. Interaction service determines what entity can be attacked by the player and either prioritises one or fetches all for sweep attacks.  
- [ ] Enemy spawner entity that requires a generic tick timer (refactor animation). Enemy spawner responds to enemy death events and respawns them.  
- [ ] Single place that the game content is initialised from, including camera entities etc.  
- [ ] Enemies can attack player by going towards them by finding player through the important entities service and using the interaction service to determine whether it can hit the player.  
- [ ] UI renders player health.  
- [ ] UI renders sword and hitting animation.  
- [ ] Downsample UI for retro effect.
