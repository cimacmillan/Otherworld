Otherworld is a web-based video game developed by [Callum Macmillan](https://github.com/cimacmillan) from Sep 2019 to December 2021. 

The game is completely [open source](https://github.com/cimacmillan/Otherworld). It uses a custom game engine, leveraging Typescript and WebGL. The in-game user interface and website are built using React and [Refunc](https://github.com/cimacmillan/Refunc). It is hosted on AWS Amplify.
